# Colorarity

Colorarity is a companypage that acts as a wholesale for paint. With fast worldwide shipping and a high variety of colors in spray cans and buckets. This is a project that acts like the Milestone project 4, which is the 
last project in the full stack course hosted by Code Institute. This project focuses on using full stack frameworks, and in this case I will be using Django.

## 1. Project Planning.
I have created a wireframe of a model I would like to create. Its intuitive for the user and the focus is on the products we sell. What I want to do differently from the Boutique Ado project where there is eyecatching designs to promote user interactions, I would like to focus on the products colors(which they are) to try and make them look good and eye-catching.<br>
There is no way bombarding the page with fancy colors and flashy designs when the product I'd sell is actual colors. And there is a need for the products to be seen clearly and not polluted by background colors and/or things that might disturb the view.<br>
While at the same time I want the page to be interesting and not look like a Windows98 interface, I think this is a case of spartan designs and a easy-on-the-eyes color palette. 

>> User Goals:
The user goals are quite self explanitary, a potential customer lands on the page looking for color, perhaps they are painting a fence, a baby chamber, or just like graffiti, who am I to judge. The user will be able to use a search function to find different colors. searching for "red", would bring up all colors with the word red in it (e.g "Sunset Red", "Coca Cola Red", "Tomato Red"). And the same for any other color. 

>> Owner Goals:
The goal for me as the company/page owner, would be to offer a reliable customer service where I sell paint to paying customers, sorting payments and shipping. To create the easiest and most trustworthy experience for the customer.

## 4. Bugs & Errors.
> My formatter extension has stopped working making everything I write a huge white wall of text.<br>
I would like to give a heads up that there might be formatting errors, comments thats wierdly placed or similar things wrong here.
Its incredibly hard to see what is what without text having different colors. Im both amused and annoyed to how hard coding must have been before
extensions were a thing.

> ~~While working on creating the navigation, I could not get my current bootstrap/JS to actually display the dropdown menu on the page, the link worked but no dropdown would show.
I went trough Slack and found similar issues that all reverted back to the source code for the Boutique Ado project.~~ I went and tried the same thing and changing the JS script CDNs 
made it work. 
<br>
<br>
> ~~The Products does render the correct template but the injected content is not displayed on screen.~~<br>
a break in the logo caused layering issues.

> **Checkout Success function stopped working**
>> after trying to implement the cached data JQuery function the checkout success function stoped working. Trying to fix with Boutique Ado source code.
>> function now works, but unsure what fixed it. Going over changes. I took the source code and compared it, and adjusted anything that looked off. Now works

> **Stripe AUTH error**
>> ~~I was having problems with authorizing stripe using my secret keys, I tried using the GitPod Env Variables but couldnt get it to work.~~<br> I changed 
>> the targeted Repos and made sure correct capitalization was used.

> **GitPod Error**
>> GitPod decided to throw me out and currently im trying to patch things back up. 
>> After throwing me out extentions like Prettier and visual enhancements are not working making it incredibly hard to read anything.

## 5. Additional Comments.
> having to end working early (21-04-04) due to scheduled power outage in my appartment complex. <br> <br>

> **if forloop.counter|divisibleby:X** <br>
> While this DID take me a good while to figure out, its an amazing feature used in the Boutique Ado project.
What this does is that there are X numbers of products displayed one each row(which changes on different screen sizes)
the HR is displayed.<br>

> **quant_input_script** <br>
>>I tried figuring out this on my own but couldnt make it work reliably and again reverted back to the source code of the Boutique Ado project,
I struggled with this for a while but finally made it work after researching both the videos and source code extensively.

> **remove_from_bag function**
>> I struggled a lot with trying to recover after GitPod crashing on me and couldnt actually make
>> this work, I headed over to the source code for the Boutique Ado project, but I will be honest and say that I

>> but it is not the way I would have wanted to work it out.

> **Webhooks**
>> Im going to be honest here, I dont think i've got a single clue on how webhooks works. Luckily they worked here with a lot of help from the Boutique Ado source code and googling.

> **Removing profile function**
>> I dont have time before deadline to implement the profile functions

## 7. Testing.
## 8. Deployment.
## 9. Conclusions.

Todays been hectic to say the least. Theres been tonnes of issues for me, and I have realized that I have not learnt enough from the course modules. I will submit this project as there isn't any more time.
I feel really bad for not completing this project as i tried to study the course materials as much as possible, but doing this left me with less time to actually create the project.
I already had an extended deadline but was not able to make it work but I would like to submit something rather than not submitting anything at all. I had an interview with a trainee program today which also stole a few hours of working time.
I know the problematic areas here and would like to fix them eventually and recieving a passing grade on this project and the course.

I was unable to set up the project on Heroku so there is nothing more than the repo to show, i would LOVE some pointers on this as I found it very hard to work with. 
if I am allowed I would like to fork this project and continue to work on it after submitting, I will ask student counceling for this. 


**2021-05-04**
By demand of the student support I had to revisit this project to get a working deployed page and link working to be able to move forward.
I have only supplied a heroku connection trough the CLI, nothing else has been added or removed as the project has already "been submitted".
